# WineQuality

The red wine quality dataset contained physical properties of wine along with a taster's rating on a scale of 1 - 10. In this notebook, I explored the data, cleaned and transformed the data where necessary, and fit the data to different machine learning algorithms to predict whether the wine was rated good or bad.
